Bubble sort
Compares pairs of adjacent values one at a time and swaps them if they are in the incorrect order. This continues until the list is sorted.
Order of n2 (Worst Case Scenario - Unsorted Array)
Omega n (Best Case Scenario - Sorted Array)


Selection sort
Iterates through the unsorted portions of a list, selecting the smallest element each time and moving it to its correct location.
Order of n2 (Worst Case Scenario - Unsorted Array)
Omega n2 (Best Case Scenario - Sorted Array)
Theta n2


Merge sort
Recursively divides the list into two repeatedly and then merges the smaller lists back into a larger one in the correct order.
Order of n log n (Worst Case Scenario - Unsorted Array)
Omega n log n (Best Case Scenario - Sorted Array)
Theta n log n
